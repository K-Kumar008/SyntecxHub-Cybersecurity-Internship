# DVWA Reflected XSS Vulnerability Scanner  
Educational Web Security Tool (Python)

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a Python-based reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
scanner developed for educational and ethical security testing. It is specifically
designed to work with Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) and other explicitly
permitted test environments.

⚠️ This tool must NOT be used against real websites or systems without written authorization.

## 🔍 What is Reflected XSS?

Reflected XSS occurs when user input is immediately returned in an HTTP response
without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing JavaScript execution in the
user’s browser.

Example vulnerable code:
```php
echo $_GET['name'];
