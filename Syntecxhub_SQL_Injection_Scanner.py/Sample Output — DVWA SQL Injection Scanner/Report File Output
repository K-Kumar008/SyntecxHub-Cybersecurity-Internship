=====================================
DVWA SQL Injection Scan Report
=====================================

Target URL:
http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/vulnerabilities/sqli/

Vulnerability Type:
SQL Injection (Boolean-based)

Affected Parameter:
id

Proof of Concept Payload:
1' OR '1'='1

Description:
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input
before using it in a SQL query. An attacker can manipulate the
query logic to bypass intended restrictions.

Impact:
An attacker may be able to:
- Bypass authentication
- Extract sensitive database information
- Modify or delete database records

Severity:
High

Remediation:
- Use prepared statements (parameterized queries)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement least-privilege database accounts

Test Environment:
Application : Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
Security    : Low
Scan Type   : Authenticated
